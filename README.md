## No more fishing! Crappy Cheat Engine Table for Yakuza 0!


So there's a side quest which requires 3 type of fish, and I spent a lot of time on that and I still got nothing. 

So here it is, a crappy cheat table for inventory cheat. The reason it's crappy is because it only got 1 address, which is the first inventory slot of Majima, and I added id for those 3 fishes in the dropdown only, but I believe u guys can explore more on that lol.

Since I'm too lazy to find the address for the number of items, one way to use the table is to put something that u don't need(like free napkins) to the first slot, and use the cheat to change its id. If u just change its id when its empty, u'll get an item with quantity of 0, which is not usable.
